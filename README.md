Feedback:
After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player.
If the guessed number is too high, the game informs the player and prompts them to guess again.
If the guessed number is too low, the game informs the player and prompts them to guess again.
If the guessed number is correct, the game congratulates the player and ends.
End:
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.
The game displays the number of attempts taken by the player to guess the correct number.
